My project is an integrated AI decision-support system called sherpAI.

I designed it to solve a common business problem: optimizing inventory ordering and securing supply chain financing. It combines advanced machine learning with a generative AI layer.

Machine Learning (ML): I use the Prophet forecasting model to analyze historical sales data and accurately predict future demand. This prediction is used to calculate the precise, risk-adjusted optimal order quantity.

Integrated Finance: The system calculates a dynamic financial LCS (Liquidity, Credit, Solvency) Score for the business and automatically determines the approval status and terms for financing the Purchase Order (PO).

Generative AI (LLM): I integrated a Large Language Model (LLM) (specifically, the Llama model via Ollama) to analyze all these results—the forecast, the optimal quantity, the best supplier, and the financial status—and generate a comprehensive, human-readable recommendation report for the business user.

In short, it's an end-to-end intelligent agent that turns raw data and complex predictions into an actionable business decision.
